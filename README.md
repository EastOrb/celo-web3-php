# celo-web3-php

## Get started

I assume that anyone going through this tutorial already understands and uses **Composer**, so I will skip the setup involved in getting **Composer** to work on your development computer. That means I assume you already have VS Code setup on your PC. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

If you are entirely new to php development and never use **Composer** before, here ( https://getcomposer.org/ ) is a good place you can learn from.

## Install dependecies

```bash
composer install
```
